# Test.Maui App (.NET MAUI App - November 2023)

This .NET MAUI app targeting .NET 8 and using CommunityToolkit.Maui v7 demonstrates two issues with CommunityToolkit.Maui Popup control.

First issue: On iOS when an Entry or Picker placed inside a Popup, placing focus on Entry/Picker makes the control scroll out of the screen.
